Notes:


It wasn't clear to me how we were supposed to do several things in this lab, so I will list them here
to clarify:

Q1.
I'm not sure what we were supposed to do with the StudentPrivate class besides make a class that inherited
privately from the person class, since it didn't look like StudentPrivate affected the output at all.  Also,
since we change the functions in Student after Q1, the output will not be consistent, therefore, I have made
it so that my code only produces the output for Q2 and Q3 so that it does not override the correct Q1 output.  I 
would have made new .cpp files for each question, but the directions say not to.  

I felt like the directions for Q1 were too vague this time and I would appreciate more specifics in the future.
Thanks!

Q3.
In Q3, I used a vector instead of an array, since I was already storing the pointers in there before.  Also, the
TA said "The data structure could be the same".  I interpreted that as it's fine to keep using the vector.
