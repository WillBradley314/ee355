Notes:


It wasn't clear to me how we were supposed to do several things in this lab, so I will list them here
to clarify:

Q1.
I wasn't sure how we were supposed to do the private part of Q1, so I made another vector of type Person pointers
and added objects of type StudentPrivate to it. This doesn't work bc of private inheritance, but I think that is
the goal.  I also called displayPersonInfo() on that, but I commented both of these out because if I leave them the
code won't work right.  

Q3.
In Q3, I used a vector instead of an array, since I was already storing the pointers in there before.  Also, the
TA said "The data structure could be the same".  I interpreted that as it's fine to keep using the vector.
