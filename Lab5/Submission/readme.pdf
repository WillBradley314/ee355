Notes:

In part 2, I had to change the order of certain actions in the starter code so that it made sense.
I'm assuming this was a mistake.  Otherwise, my code should be as specified and produces the correct 
output.


Operation:

Compile normally with g++.
Run as specified in the lab manual:
./Lab5Part1.out
./Lab5Part2.out <num1> <num2>  . . .  <numN>
