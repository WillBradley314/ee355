Notes:

Nothing to comment, all working.


Operation:

Compile .cpp normally with g++, run python script with python3
To run:
    
    ./fibonacci_recursive.out <number>

    ./fibonacci_dp.out <number>

    python3 fibonacci.py <number>

    ./brokengdb1_correct.out
    Enter number to factorial

    ./broken_ASan_correct.out



GDB Part


    First time running, received the following error:

        Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
        0x00005555555552ab in factorial (n=3) at brokengdb1_correct.cpp:22
        22	        return  factorial(n--)*n;

    Looking at line 22, I decided this was probably due to the function 
    argument of n-- instead of n-1.  This is because n-- evaluates to n, 
    so the recursion would not progress and it would cause a stack 
    overflow from all the function calls, causing the SIGSEGV error.  
    After replacing n-- with n-1, it seems to work normally, and gave the 
    following output:

        Please enter n:
        4
        n factorial is: 24
        [Inferior 1 (process 4949) exited normally]



ASAN Part

    First time running, received the following error:

        SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow /home/will-bradley/ee355-new/Lab6
        /broken_ASan_correct.cpp:5 in partition(int*, int, int)

    Looking at line 5, I noticed that the program was trying to assign the pivot to arr[high], 
    which does not exist because high is the length of the array, so I changed high to n-1 in
    the function call.  Then I recompiled and reran:

        SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow /home/will-bradley/ee355-new/Lab6
        /broken_ASan_correct.cpp:41 in printArray(int*, int)

    Looking at line 41, we can clearly see that the for loop is configured to go beyond the
    size of the array, so I changed the i <= size to i < size.  Then I recompiled and reran
    and the list was properly sorted.  I noticed the output was printing "n", so I assumed
    that was a mistake and that it meant to make a new line and therefore changed it to "\n".
